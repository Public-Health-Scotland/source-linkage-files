The Source Linkage Files (SLF) are a linked dataset maintained by the
Health and Social Care (H&SC) team at Public Health Scotland (PHS). This
repo contains the R code to develop the package called `createslf` which
is used for the production and maintenance of the SLFs. The entire
process is contained within this git repository.

The SLFs are updated on a quarterly basis with updates taking place in
March, June, September and December. If you are using the files and spot
a problem, please let us know and we will work closely with you to fix
this. Alternatively, if you would like to see a new feature on the SLFs,
please get in touch and we can look into your request.

## Access

Access to the Source Linkage Files is only available to approved users
in the Local Intelligence Support Team (LIST), Health and Social Care
(H&SC) and Whole System Modelling (WSM) teams within PHS. For anyone
interested in using the SLFs outside of these teams, please contact the
source mailbox to discuss this.

## Documentation

Documentation for the SLFs is available upon request. We have further
information available relating to our standard operating
procedures(SOP), reference document, episode file layout, individual
file layout and FAQs. If you are interested in accessing our
documentation, please contact the source mailbox for more information.

## Questions

If you have a SLF question, please get in touch either by email or
through Microsoft Teams on the [Source Linkage File
Team](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/team/19%3a94a97159a3c44358b2244ee450d4fc27%40thread.tacv2/conversations?groupId=c7901246-d78a-48a7-b8bb-2300aae094f3&tenantId=10efe0bd-a030-4bca-809c-b5e6745e499a)

## Slfhelper

We recommend using the package
[slfhelper](https://github.com/Public-Health-Scotland/slfhelper) to
access the files. This is an R package created for reading the SLFs
efficiently. Please note that slfhelper will only work for those with
access to the PHS confi stats drive.
