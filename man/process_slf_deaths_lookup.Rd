\code{TRUE} i.e. write the data to disk.}

\description{
Use all-year refined death data to produce year-specific
slf_deaths_lookup with deceased flag added.

Currently this just uses the NRS death dates 'as is', with no
corrections or modifications, it is expected that this will be expanded to
use the CHI deaths extract from IT as well as taking into account data in
the episode file to assess the validity of a death date.
