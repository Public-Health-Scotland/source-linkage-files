\title{Write an SPSS zsav file}
\usage{
write_sav(data, path, compress = "zsav")
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{\link[tibble:tibble-package]{tibble} to write.}

\item{path}{Path to where the data will be written.}

\item{compress}{Compression type to use:
\itemize{
\item "byte": uses byte compression (The default in SPSS).
\item "none": no compression. This is useful for software that has issues with
byte compressed \code{.sav} files (e.g. SAS).
\item "zsav": The default, uses zlib compression and produces a \code{.zsav} file.
zlib compression is supported by SPSS version 21.0 and above.
}

\code{TRUE} and \code{FALSE} can be used for backwards compatibility, and correspond
to the "zsav" and "none" options respectively.}
}
\value{
\code{write_sav()} returns the input \code{data} invisibly.
}
\description{
Wrapper around \code{\link[haven:read_spss]{haven::write_sav()}} but with compression as
default, it also corrects the file permissions to be writeable by the group,
which is often an issue in the PHS RStudio server.
