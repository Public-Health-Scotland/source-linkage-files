}
\arguments{
\item{data}{R object to write to serialise.}

\item{path}{Path to where the data will be written.}

\item{compress}{Compression method to use: "none", "gz" ,"bz", or "xz".}

\item{...}{Additional arguments to \link[readr:read_rds]{write_rds()} and the
subsequent connection function. For example, control the space-time trade-off
of different compression methods with \code{compression}. See \code{\link[=connections]{connections()}}
for more details.}

\description{
Wrapper around \code{\link[readr:read_rds]{readr::write_rds()}}, but with maximum 'xz' compression as
default, it also corrects the file permissions to be writeable by the group,
which is often an issue in the PHS RStudio server.
