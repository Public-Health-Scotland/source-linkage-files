\description{
This is meant to be used with \code{\link[=phs_db_connection]{phs_db_connection()}}, it can only be used
interactively i.e. not in targets or in a workbench job.

With the default options it will go through the steps to set up a keyring
which can be used to supply passwords to \code{\link[odbc:dbConnect-OdbcDriver-method]{odbc::dbConnect()}} (or others) in a
secure and seamless way.
\enumerate{
\item Create an .Renviron file in the project and add a password (for the
keyring) to it.
\item Create a keyring with the password - Since we have saved the password as
an environment variable it can be picked unlocked and used automatically.
\item Add the database password to the keyring.
