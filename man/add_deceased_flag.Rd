\arguments{
\item{year}{The year to process, in FY format.}

\item{write_to_disk}{(optional) Should the data be written to disk default is
\code{TRUE} i.e. write the data to disk.}

\item{nrs_deaths_data}{NRS deaths data.}

a \link[tibble:tibble-package]{tibble} containing the episode file

\description{
Currently this just uses the NRS death dates 'as is', with no
corrections or modifications, it is expected that this will be expanded to
use the CHI deaths extract from IT as well as taking into account data in
the episode file to assess the validity of a death date.
