\usage{
get_file_path(
  directory,
  file_name = NULL,
  ext = NULL,
  check_mode = "read",
  create = NULL,
  file_name_regexp = NULL,
  selection_method = "modification_date"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{directory}{The file directory}

\item{file_name}{The file name (with extension if not supplied to \code{ext})}

\item{ext}{The extension (type of the file) - optional}

\item{check_mode}{The mode passed to
\code{\link[fs:file_access]{fs::file_access()}}, defaults to "read"
to check that you have read access to the file}

\item{create}{Optionally create the file if it doesn't exists,
the default is to only create a file if we set \code{check_mode = "write"}}

\item{file_name_regexp}{A regular expression to search for the file name
if this is used \code{file_name} should not be, it will return the most recently
created file using \code{\link[=find_latest_file]{find_latest_file()}}}

\item{selection_method}{Passed only to \code{\link[=find_latest_file]{find_latest_file()}}, will select the file based
on latest modification date (default) or file name}
}
\value{
The full file path, an error will be thrown
if the path doesn't exist or it's not readable
}
\description{
This generic function takes a directory and
file name then checks to make sure they exist.
The parameter \code{check_mode} will also test to make sure
the file is readable (default) or writeable (\code{check_mode = "write"}).
By default it will return an error if the file doesn't exist
but with \code{create = TRUE} it will create an empty file with
appropriate permissions.
