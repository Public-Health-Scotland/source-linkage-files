# R SLF Development SOP

## Background

The aim of this SOP is to provide background to and a framework for contributing to the SLF (Source Linkage Files) R project.

## Branching

Generally speaking we use the [GitHub Flow model](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/github-flow) for R development, with the [main-R branch](https://github.com/Public-Health-Scotland/source-linkage-files/tree/main-R) being the base brach.
