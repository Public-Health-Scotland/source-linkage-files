## Package set up 

The repo contains the code to develop the package `createslf`which is used for the production and maintenance of the Source Linkage Files (SLFs).


## Folders 

* **man** - Documentation folder for all functions. When the package goes through checks, this will be populated automatically and should not be edited by hand. To make changes to function documentation, you should do this in the roxygen documentation found above every function.  
* **Pre_processing_scripts** - This folder contains scripts which should be ran prior to processing. 
* **R** - The main folder of functions which make up the `createslf` package. 
* **Rmarkdown** - Rmarkdown files mainly used for processing costs.
* **Run_SLF_Files_manually** - This folder contains the top level scripts for running the whole process. 
* **Run_SLF_Files_targets** - This folder contains the top level scripts for running the targets pipeline. 
* **tests** - This folder contains tests for each function which ensures the package is working efficiently. 
* **vignettes** - This folder contains vignettes used to populate Articles on the `createslf` website. 


## Functions 

**Boxi Extracts** - Extracts downloaded from BOXI include Acute(SMR01), Accident & Emergency(AE2), Maternity(SMR02), Mental Health(SMR04), Outpatients(SMR00), NRS Deaths, Homelessness(HL1) and GP Out of Hours(OOH). The following functions are used to process these extracts prior to linkage.

* **read_extract_XXX** - Function for reading in each extract prior to processing.

* **process_extract_XXX** - Function for processing each extract into a format for linkage.

* **process_tests_XXX** - Function for processing tests for each extract. This produces high level counts for comparison to the files produced last quarter. We check this to ensure we are happy with our outputs. 


**Social Care Extracts** - Extracts taken from the Social Care Platform include: Alarms Telecare(AT), Care Homes(CH), Home Care(HC) and Self-directed Support(SDS). We also extract Client information and Demographic information from the platform. We extract all years from the platform during the processing stage and then filter this to financial year for inclusion. 

* **read_sc_all_XXX** - Function for reading social care **ALL** data from the social care platform.

* **process_sc_all_XXX** - Function for processing **ALL** social care data.

* **process_extract_XXX** - Function for taking the processed **ALL** social care data and processing each extract into financial year. 

* **process_tests_XXX** - Function for processing tests for each extract. This produces high level counts for comparison to the files produced last quarter. We check this to ensure we are happy with our outputs. 


**Episode File**

* **create_episode_file** - This is the top level script that will create the episode file, linking to many functions within the project. 

* **process_tests_episode_file** - Function for processing tests for each extract. This produces high level counts for comparison to the files produced last quarter. We check this to ensure we are happy with our outputs. 


**Individual File**

* **create_individual_file** - This is the top level script that will create the individual file, linking to many functions within the project.

* **process_tests_individual_file** - Function for processing tests for each extract. This produces high level counts for comparison to the files produced last quarter. We check this to ensure we are happy with our outputs.
