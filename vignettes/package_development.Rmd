### Background

The Source Linkage Files (SLFs) project was created using SPSS syntax until March 2022 when this was transformed into R programming language. The project has evolved into it's own R package called `createslf` which contains functions for maintaining the Reproducible Analytical Pipeline (RAP) to create the SLFs on a quarterly basis.

The package bundles together code, data, documentation, and tests, and is easy to share with others. To create the package `createslf` we refer to the [R Packages](https://r-pkgs.org/introduction.html) guide by Hadley Wickham. 

### Developing createslf - setup 

The `createslf` structure follows: 

R/ directory
DESCRIPTION file
NAMESPACE file





### Development Best Practice: 
* All function names should be in lower case, with words separated by an underscore
* Put a space after a comma, never before
* Put a space before and after infix operators such as <-, == and +
* Limit code to 80 characters per line
* Function documentation should be generated using roxygen2
* Functions should be tested using testthat where possible
* The package should always pass devtools::check()
