* Encoding: UTF-8.

 * Build the GPprac Lookup.
 * Email NSS.isdGeneralPractice asking for an updated GP Clusters file (Practice Details.sav)
 * Save the Cluster file to \\stats\irf\05-lookups\04-geography\Practice Details.sav.

 * Check the file from Primary care team is sorted by practice.
get file = !Lookup + "Practice Details.sav".
sort cases by PracticeCode.
save outfile = !Lookup + "Practice Details.sav".

 * Sort the national ref file by practice.
get file = "/conf/linkage/output/lookups/Unicode/National Reference Files/gpprac.sav"
   /Keep praccode postcode end.

sort cases by praccode.

 * Match the cluster information onto the practice reference list.
 * This won't match all as cluster info is only added to currently active practices, we keep old practices as we can still add geography info to these.

   /Rename (praccode = gpprac)
   /Table = !Lookup + "Practice Details.sav"
   /Rename (PracticeCode = gpprac)
   /by gpprac.

 * Fix the Locale -> Unicode issue.
alter type cluster (A50).
alter type postcode (A8).

 * Match on Geography info (the postcode from the ref file is PC8).
sort cases by Postcode.

 * Use CA2011 to produce the 2-char LCA codes.
String LCA (A2).

 * These macros are defined in A01, so this needs to be run before and in the same session as the following.
!CAtoLCA.

 * Set some known dummy practice codes to consistent Board codes.
Do if any(gpprac, 99942, 99957, 99961, 99976, 99981, 99999).
    Compute hbpraccode = "S08200003". /*Out-with Scotland / unknown*/.
Else if gpprac = 99995.
    Compute hbpraccode = "S08200001".  /*RUK*/.
End if.

 * Add dictionary info.
!AddLCADictionaryInfo LCA = LCA.
!AddHB2018DictionaryInfo HB = hbpraccode.

 * Sort by gpprac before saving.
Sort cases by gpprac.

 * Save out, rename HB2018 for source, keep LCA etc. for others (Andrew Mooney).
